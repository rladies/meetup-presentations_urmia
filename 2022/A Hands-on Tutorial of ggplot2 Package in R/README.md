### Workshop Slides

Slides from this workshop are available <a href = "https://jenineharris.github.io/r-ladies-urmia-slides/slides-urmia-2022.html">here</a>.

### Workshop Instructions

R is a statistical software that is <a href = "https://www.r-project.org">free, open-source, and can run on most operating systems</a>. This means that anyone in the world with access to a computer and the internet can use it and anyone in the world can contribute to the development of new tools in R. 

R can do everything that paid statistical software like SPSS and SAS can do, and often more! <a href = "http://r4stats.com/2019/05/28/data-science-jobs-report-2019-python-way-up-tensorflow-growing-rapidly-r-use-double-sas/">Analysis of data on job openings and other metrics</a> shows that R is increasingly included as a desired or required skill, often surpassing traditional closed source software like SPSS and SAS. R is particularly great for **data management** and developing amazing **data visualizations**. This workshop is designed to get you started on data visualization in R. 

Before the Workshop on **Thursday, June 30, 2022** complete the following steps so that you can follow along:

<ul>
  <li> Install R and R Studio
  <li> Download the workshop files 
</ul>

### Step 1: Install R and R Studio

R is the software and R Studio is the IDE (Interactive Development Environment) that makes R easier to use. Install R **before** you install R Studio because R Studio will look for R during installation.

If you already have R installed, check the version to make sure that it is at least version 3.3, many of the features that we will be using will not work in versions prior to 3.3.

First, download and install R:

<ul>
  <li> Click the <b>download R</b> link on the <a href = "https://www.r-project.org">R Project for Statistical Computing</a> website
  <li> Choose one of the options from the <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">CRAN Mirrors</a> list (it doesn't matter which one!)
  <li> Click on the download that is appopropriate for your operating system, Linux, Mac, or Windows; if you are not given this option, go back to the <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">CRAN Mirrors</a> and try a different one
  <li> Find the link for <b>install R for the first time</b> and click on it
  <li> Click on the the <b>Download R</b> link on the page that opens
  <li> Use the installer that downloads to install R 
</ul>

Second, download and install R Studio:

<ul>
  <li> Go to the R Studio <a href = "https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/"> downloads page</a> 
  <li> Click on the DOWNLOAD button under the RStudio Desktop column on the downloads page
  <li> Choose the Download for the operating system you have and click on it  
  <li> Use the installer that downloads to install R Studio 
</ul>

### Step 2: Download the workshop files 

Download the participant files and save them together in the same folder on your computer:

<ul>
  <li> Click on the green <b>Code</b> button toward the top of this GitHub page 
  <li> Choose Download ZIP
  <li> Unzip the downloaded zip file and save all the files in a single folder on your computer 
</ul>
