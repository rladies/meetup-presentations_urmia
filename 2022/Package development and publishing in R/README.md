Abstract:
Do you have a collection of functions that you'd like to share with your colleagues or publish publicly for others to use?
In this workshop, we step through a conventional workflow for building R packages. We will also introduce different avenues for publishing and distributing R packages. If you already have scattered R scripts, please bring them along to practice building a package during the workshop.
